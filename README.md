## Overview

GODEL ("guh-*delle*") augments any SOC stack with real-time field analysis of information environments. Full stop.

It identifies the *geometric signatures* of coordinated, manipulative, failing, or otherwise anomalous information dynamics across multiple time scales. Built on principles of differential geometry applied to semantic embeddings, it models information as a high-dimensional geometric field. Healthy adaptive dynamics in that field break down in quantifiable (and immediately recognizable) ways.

**This can detect and forecast those structural vulnerabilities in information flows before traditional systems recognize their presence.**

The GODEL engine identifies 12 orthogonal failure modes inherent to all information environments, which can occur simultaneously, across four categories. The signatures emerge consistently: in cognition during psychological crises, in cultural dynamics during social upheaval, in institutional behavior under organizational stress, and in all information environments under strain.

Their downstream effects threaten organizations and teams at every scale. Predicting and detecting them early is a matter of using the same mathematics governing coherence and entropy in all complex systems.

## Capabilities

**Privacy-preserving: GODEL measures fields and vectors, NEVER raw content.**

### Coordination Analysis
- Analyzes geometric coupling between information sources using recursive coupling tensors
- Scores coordination likelihood through field equation-based confidence metrics
- Measures information concentration via semantic mass distribution analysis
- Tracks pattern evolution using temporal field dynamics over configurable time windows

### Escalation Prediction
- Calculates coherence acceleration through semantic trajectory curvature analysis
- Identifies threshold approaches via geometric signature trend analysis
- Ranks intervention urgency using time-sensitive severity scoring algorithms
- Maps system transitions through field evolution simulation and stability analysis

## Applications

### For Investigators & Analysts

Before breakdowns occur...  
Without ever seeing the content...  
GODEL <u>proactively</u> measures how information structures are changing. It:

- Detects threat patterns solely by analyzing recursive coupling between information sources
- Measures escalation trajectories using coherence field acceleration and Ricci curvature  
- Quantifies coordination signatures via semantic mass concentration and interpretive breakdown metrics
- Generates early warnings with real-time geometric severity scoring and mathematical evidence for each detection

### For Cybersecurity & UEBA
Extending User and Entity Behavior Analytics, GODEL:

- Maps user behavior via recursive coupling tensors and semantic mass distribution
- Identifies insider threats through extractive behavior and coordination pattern recognition
- Detects account compromise via high-dimensional signature changes in field evolution
- Uncovers coordinated attacks through network-level coupling analysis and field coordination metrics

### For Organizations
At all scales, communication systems under stress, duress, dogmatism, delusion, or otherwise exhibit predictable topological dynamics in their vector representations. And they do that *ahead of time*. GODEL leverages this to:

- Monitor communication patterns using field-theoretic signatures ***while preserving content privacy***
- Assess structural rigidity and adaptive capacity in information processing systems
- Track communication health via coherence field analysis and coupling strength measurements
- Support decision-making with quantified vulnerability assessments and trend analysis

## Geometric Detection Engine
Algorithmically detects 12 coherence breakdown signatures with real-time severity scoring (0.0-1.0) + mathematical evidence for each detection in the following categories:
