## Overview

PRISMA monitors information dynamics in vector databases to identify breakdown patterns and pathologies in communication data before they reach critical thresholds. Built on principles of differential geometry applied to semantic embeddings, it models information as a high-dimensional geometric field. Healthy adaptive dynamics in that field break down in quantifiable (and immediately recognizable) ways.

**The system detects and forecasts these structural vulnerabilities in information dynamics before traditional systems can recognize their behavior patterns.**

Calculus doesn't care about the intent, only the pattern of a true pathology. The system identifies 12 orthogonal failure modes inherent to all information environments, which can occur simultaneously, across four categories. Their signatures emerge (consistently) in cognition during psychological crises, cultural dynamics undergoing social upheaval, institutional behavior during organizational stress, and information dynamics (unintentional, reckless, malicious, or otherwise).

Their downstream effects threaten democracies, organizations, and individuals alike. Detecting and predicting them early is a matter of using the same mathematics governing coherence and entropy in all complex systems.

## Capabilities

### Coordination Analysis
- Analyzes geometric coupling between information sources using recursive coupling tensors
- Scores coordination likelihood through field equation-based confidence metrics
- Measures information concentration via semantic mass distribution analysis
- Tracks pattern evolution using temporal field dynamics over configurable time windows

### Escalation Prediction
- Calculates coherence acceleration through semantic trajectory curvature analysis
- Identifies threshold approaches via geometric signature trend analysis
- Ranks intervention urgency using time-sensitive severity scoring algorithms
- Maps system transitions through field evolution simulation and stability analysis

### Pathology Detection Engine
Algorithmically detects 12 distinct pathological patterns with real-time severity scoring (0.0-1.0) + mathematical evidence for each detection in the following categories:

#### <span style="color: #EA503F">Rigidity Pathologies</span> *(Over-constraint → brittleness)*

- **Metric Crystallization**
  - *Interpretive frameworks freeze while tensions persist*
  - Signature: `∂g_ij/∂t → 0 while R_ij ≠ 0`  
- **Belief Calcification**
  - *Existing ideas become unresponsive to updated information or challenge*
  - Signature: `lim[ε→0] dC/dt|C+ε ≈ 0`  
- **Attractor Dogmatism**
  - *Belief systems calcify and resist adaptive change, despite external pressure*
  - Signature: `A(p,t) > A_crit ∧ ‖∇V(C)‖ ≫ Φ(C)`  

---

#### <span style="color: #FF9800">Fragmentation Pathologies</span> *(Under-constraint → disintegration)*

- **Attractor Splintering**
  - *Attention fragments faster than coherence can stabilize*
  - Signature: `dN_attractors/dt > κ·dΦ(C)/dt`  
- **Coherence Dissolution**
  - *Narrative breakdown accelerates beyond repair capacity*
  - Signature: `‖∇C‖ ≫ ‖C‖ ∧ d²C/dt² > 0`  
- **Reference Decay**
  - *Shared meaning erodes without compensatory mechanisms*
  - Signature: `d‖R_ijk‖/dt < 0` without compensation  

---

#### <span style="color: #9C27B0">Inflation Pathologies</span> *(Runaway Autopoiesis → malignancy)*

- **Recurgent Parasitism**
  - *Local semantic mass grows by directly depleting the broader semantic environment*
  - Signature: `d/dt∫_Ω M(p,t) dV > 0, d/dt∫_{M\Ω} M(p,t) dV < 0`  
- **Semantic Hypercoherence**
  - *Perfect internal consistency isolated from external input*
  - Signature: `C(p,t) > C_max, ∮F_i·dS^i < F_leakage`  
- **Delusional Expansion**
  - *Self-reinforcing growth unchecked by wisdom or humility*
  - Signature: `Φ(C) ≫ V(C), H[R] ≈ 0, W(p,t) < W_min`  

---

#### <span style="color: #1389c4">Observer-Coupling Pathologies</span> *(Interpretation Breakdowns)*

- **Observer Solipsism**
  - *Subjective interpretation diverges from objective reality*
  - Signature: `‖I_ψ[C] - C‖ > τ‖C‖`  
- **Paranoid Interpretation**
  - *Negative bias systematically filters information processing*
  - Signature: `Ĉ_ψ(q,t) ≪ C(q,t), ∀q ∈ Q`  
- **Semantic Narcissism**
  - *Self-reference dominates over external coupling*
  - Signature: `‖R_ijk(p,p,t)‖/∫‖R_ijk(p,q,t)‖dq → 1`

## Applications

### For Investigators & Analysts
Legacy investigative tools retroactively analyze *what* happened. PRISMA <u>proactively</u> analyzes *how* information structures are changing *before breakdowns occur*. While preserving privacy, it:

- Detects threat patterns by analyzing recursive coupling between information sources
- Measures escalation trajectories using coherence field acceleration and semantic curvature  
- Quantifies threat signatures via semantic mass concentration and interpretive breakdown metrics
- Generates early warnings with real-time pathology severity scoring and mathematical evidence for each detection

### For Organizations
At all scales, communication systems under stress, duress, dogmatism, delusion, or otherwise exhibit highly predictable geometric dynamics in their vector representations. And they do that *ahead of time*. PRISMA leverages this to:

- Monitor communication patterns using field-theoretic signatures ***while preserving content privacy***
- Assess structural rigidity and adaptive capacity in information processing systems
- Track communication health via coherence field analysis and coupling strength measurements
- Support decision-making with quantified vulnerability assessments and trend analysis
