# PRISM: Pathology Recognition In Semantic Manifolds

*A geometric analysis system that detects structural failures in information environments using differential geometry applied to semantic vector databases (PostgreSQL + pgvector).*

## Overview

PRISM monitors information dynamics in vector databases to identify breakdown patterns and pathologies in communication data before they reach critical thresholds. Built on principles of differential geometry applied to semantic embeddings, it models information as a high-dimensional geometric field. Healthy adaptive dynamics in that field break down in quantifiable (and immediately recognizable) ways.

**PRISM detects and forecasts structural vulnerabilities in information dynamics before traditional systems can recognize their behavior patterns.**

Calculus doesn't care about the intent, only the pattern of a true pathology. The system identifies 12 orthogonal failure modes inherent to all information environments, which can occur simultaneously, across four categories. Their signatures consistently emerge in cognition during psychological crises, cultural dynamics undergoing social upheaval, institutional behavior during organizational stress, and information dynamics (unintentional, reckless, malicious, or otherwise).

Their downstream effects threaten democracies, institutions, and individuals alike. Detecting and predicting them early is a matter of usingthe same mathematics governing coherence and entropy in all complex systems.



## Applications

### For Investigators & Analysts
Legacy investigative tools retroactively analyze *what* happened. PRISM <u>proactively</u> analyzes *how* information structures are changing *before breakdowns occur*. While preserving privacy, it:

- Detects threat patterns by analyzing recursive coupling between information sources
- Measures escalation trajectories using coherence field acceleration and semantic curvature  
- Quantifies threat signatures via semantic mass concentration and interpretive breakdown metrics
- Generates early warnings with real-time pathology severity scoring and mathematical evidence for each detection

### For Organizations
At all scales, communication systems under stress, duress, dogmatism, delusion, or otherwise exhibit highly predictable geometric dynamics in their vector representations. And they do that *ahead of time*. PRISM leverages this to:

- Monitor communication patterns using field-theoretic signatures ***while preserving content privacy***
- Assess structural rigidity and adaptive capacity in information processing systems
- Track communication health via coherence field analysis and coupling strength measurements
- Support decision-making with quantified vulnerability assessments and trend analysis

## Capabilities

### Pathology Detection Engine
Algorithmically detects 12 distinct pathological patterns with real-time severity scoring (0.0-1.0) + mathematical evidence for each detection:

**Rigidity Pathologies** *(Over-constraint → brittleness)*
- **Metric Crystallization**: `∂g_ij/∂t → 0 while R_ij ≠ 0`  
  *Interpretive frameworks freeze while tensions persist*
- **Belief Calcification**: `lim[ε→0] dC/dt|C+ε ≈ 0`  
  *Existing ideas become unresponsive to updated information or challenge*
- **Attractor Dogmatism**: `A(p,t) > A_crit ∧ ‖∇V(C)‖ ≫ Φ(C)`  
  *Belief systems calcify and resist adaptive change, despite external pressure*

**Fragmentation Pathologies** *(Under-constraint → disintegration)*
- **Attractor Splintering**: `dN_attractors/dt > κ·dΦ(C)/dt`  
  *Attention fragments faster than coherence can stabilize*
- **Coherence Dissolution**: `‖∇C‖ ≫ ‖C‖ ∧ d²C/dt² > 0`  
  *Narrative breakdown accelerates beyond repair capacity*
- **Reference Decay**: `d‖R_ijk‖/dt < 0` without compensation  
  *Shared meaning erodes without compensatory mechanisms*

**Inflation Pathologies** *(Runaway Autopoiesis → malignancy)*
- **Recurgent Parasitism**: `d/dt∫_Ω M(p,t) dV > 0, d/dt∫_{M\Ω} M(p,t) dV < 0`  
  *Local semantic mass grows by directly depleting the broader semantic environment*
- **Semantic Hypercoherence**: `C(p,t) > C_max, ∮F_i·dS^i < F_leakage`  
  *Perfect internal consistency isolated from external input*
- **Delusional Expansion**: `Φ(C) ≫ V(C), H[R] ≈ 0, W(p,t) < W_min`  
  *Self-reinforcing growth unchecked by wisdom or humility*

**Observer-Coupling Pathologies** *(Interpretation Breakdown)*
- **Observer Solipsism**: `‖I_ψ[C] - C‖ > τ‖C‖`  
  *Subjective interpretation diverges from objective reality*
- **Paranoid Interpretation**: `Ĉ_ψ(q,t) ≪ C(q,t), ∀q ∈ Q`  
  *Negative bias systematically filters information processing*
- **Semantic Narcissism**: `‖R_ijk(p,p,t)‖/∫‖R_ijk(p,q,t)‖dq → 1`  
  *Self-reference dominates over external coupling*
